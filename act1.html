                <p>
                    Though many species are quite similar, Parrots are an immensely diverse group of birds. They come in
                    many different
                    shapes, sizes, and colors. As a whole, all of them have curved bills and zygodactyl toes, with two
                    facing forward and
                    two facing backward. Their coloration varies from species to species, and some are orange, green,
                    blue, yellow, red etc
