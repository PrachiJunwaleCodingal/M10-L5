    <h2>Maharastra Dishes That Are a Must-try!</h2><br>
    <h4>From the world-famous pav bhaji to the delicious poha, Maharashtra Food has a lot to offer. Food of Mahrashtra
        of
        Maharashtrian cuisine can be broadly classified into two styles- Konkan and Varadi. Konkan being from the
        coastal region
        has influences from Goan, Saraswat, Gaud and Malvani regions. Varadi cuisine, on the other hand, belongs to the
        Vidarbha
        region. Some spices like Goda Masala, Kokum, Tamarind and Coconut are essential ingredients in the Maharashtrian
        kitchen. Maharashtrian cuisine is considered to be very diverse as the flavours and spice levels differ in
        different
        parts of the state.</h4>
